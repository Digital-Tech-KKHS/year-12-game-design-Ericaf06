# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
I have began moving around the boss and started working on my map development using my own art/ making my art to fit the theme of my game(mystical forest). I am fixing more bugs to make my game more polished.

Because of the strike days at home continued I have had to do more work at home which can cause mishaps with the pushing and pulling down of repos, as well as tiled maps.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- More Map development
- Art development using Aesprite

## **Brief Description of your testing**
I tested enemy movement and boss following using atan2.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
Next time I will focus on making the art and more map development so that the game looks better to play. I have finished all my code and it is functional meaning next sprint I will not have to worry about the code. I still have to create the sounds for the game as well.
