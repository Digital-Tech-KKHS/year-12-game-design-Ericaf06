- Review your initial game design document. Compare and contrast the game you had initially planned and your final outcome. 

I did not have a concept for the game set in stone however I vaguely planned on making a space shooter themed game. However with map development and the type of code I wrote I came up with the concept of a mystical forest for a game.

- Given each of the initial success criteria that you determined when designing your project, was your game a success? Why or why not? 

Much of my success criteria were aspects of a MVP. My game is now an MVP as well as following all the criteria I set for myself.  All of the success criteria my code and my art follows. Overall I can say the game I designed was a success.

- Describe the testing process you undertook to ensure your game functioned as intended. 

The purpose of my testing process was to see whether my code functioned under all the different conditions it may encounter in the game. This means I was able to spot the bugs and fix them so that my game functioned smoothly.

- Describe your trialing process, and the impact that it had on the development of your outcome. 

I trialed various different users with my game and various different stages. All the users I trialed fit within the category my game was designed for. This allows me to determine whether my game complies with the users in the category I designed my game for. Having users trial my game in the development of it is also beneficial as they can influence part of the design especially visual features and I can also get a census for what the majority of users may prefer.

- Discuss in detail how testing and trialing the components of your game lead to the development of a high quality task. 

Both my testing and my trialing process allowed me to improve my code. If I did not test my code I wouldn't fully know if it was able to work under all possible circumstances and if I didn't trial end users I wouldn't be sure if my game was that of good quality. Therefore both of these processes work together to allow me to produce a higher quality game.

- Given the opportunity to develop this game again, what parts of the *process* would you change and why?

If I could change the way I followed the process I would run more trials. Although I had an A, B trial for all 5 sprints I still feel like having more would give me the opportunity to further improve my game. I would also come up with a concept at the beginning of the development process so I can shape my code to fit the theme and design I had in mind. Because I feel that towards the end of my coding process I couldn't do any more until I had created the art. Having a map to add to as you go along is something I would also work on doing instead of having a place holder map. This is because creating a map at the very end put me under more pressure than if I had just decided to work on it throughout my coding process. I would also try and add extra things such as tokens or non-interactable objects that just make the map look better. However that does depend on the amount of some I would had.
