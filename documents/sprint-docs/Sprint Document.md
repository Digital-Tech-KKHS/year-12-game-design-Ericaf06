# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
I originally planned on acheiving only moving enemies in my game. However I also ended up adding shooting bullets through mouse press. I also added ladder logic in my physics engine and key press. 

My end users so far are guiding me into making decsisions such as having a mouse press for shooting bullets instead of a key press. I also found that allowing the bullets to shoot in any direction is easier to achieve through mouse press is easier than key press.

I acheived more in my sprint than I planned on doing, and have my kanban board to help me decide what I need to work on next sprint.
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Moving enemies added
- The player can shoot in any direction and be able to kill enemies through bullets.
- Functioning ladders
- Mouse and key movement 


## **Brief Description of your testing**
For the ladder logic testing I tested to make sure the player climbed up the ladder smoothly and stopped when the key was released. When I first tested it the ladder it did not function properly until I added ladders to the physics engine as a variable.
