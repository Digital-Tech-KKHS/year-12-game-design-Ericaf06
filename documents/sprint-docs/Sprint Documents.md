# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
I originally planned on acheiving only moving enemies in my game. However I also ended up adding shooting bullets through mouse press. I also added ladder logic in my physics engine and key press. 

My end users so far are guiding me into making decsisions such as having a mouse press for shooting bullets instead of a key press. I also found that allowing the bullets to shoot in any direction is easier to achieve through mouse press is easier than key press.

I acheived more in my sprint than I planned on doing, and have my kanban board to help me decide what I need to work on next sprint.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Moving enemies added
- The player can shoot in any direction and be able to kill enemies through bullets.
- Functioning ladders
- Mouse and key movement 
- Player movement

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
Next time I should focus on completing one aspect at a time, because I worked on multiple aspects at one time I found it was all over the place and things didn't get fully completed. I also want to have a wider range of things on my kanban to work on to be more efficient.

Because we had a lot of time off school during this sprint I had to manage my time at home.
