# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I focused on developing the mvp fully. To do this I still had to make a way for the player to win. Like I suggested I do in my last sprint I have begun adding a boss enemy which takes damage and when killed makes the player win and displays a win screen. 
The main functions of this final boss that I have begun adding is that the boss follows my player using atan2 and that the player has to defeat the boss to be able to win.


## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
-Code format changed to be better
-Boss added into the game
-Map design added


## **Brief Description of your testing**
For my testing in this sprint I tested the do not touch function which represents things in the map that kill the player such as enemies, spikes, and lava, as well as the function for handling collisions with enemies.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
From my trailing  that I did I will be implementing more key features that the users feel most comfortable using, I will also be moving more towards art design e.g. Characters, background and, tile sets. As well as making the map more interesting and fun for the player .
