# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
I originally planned on achieving only moving enemies in my game. However I also ended up adding shooting bullets through mouse press. I also added ladder logic in my physics engine and key press. 

My end users so far are guiding me into making decisions such as having a mouse press for shooting bullets instead of a key press. I also found that allowing the bullets to shoot in any direction is easier to achieve through mouse press is easier than key press.

I achieved more in my sprint than I planned on doing, and have my kanban board to help me decide what I need to work on next sprint.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Moving enemies added
- The player can shoot in any direction and be able to kill enemies through bullets.
- Functioning ladders
- Mouse and key movement 
- Player movement


## **Brief Description of your testing**
For the testing in this sprint I focused on the player collecting coins and the logic for the ladder functioning in the game. 
Testing these pieces of code allowed me to spot bugs such as the player not being able to shoot on the ladder as well as some errors in my code preventing the score from going up when a player collects the coins. This will help me improve the quality of my game.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
Next time I should focus on completing one aspect at a time, because I worked on multiple aspects at one time I found it was all over the place and things didn't get fully completed. I also want to have a wider range of things on my kanban to work on to be more efficient. My main goal is developing and mvp therefore I should focus on completing the aspects that make an mvp before moving onto map design and art in future sprints.
