_Name:_ Erica Ford
## Trial #1
_Date:_  4/04/2023
Involved in the trial
- Mitchell
- Braeden
## Trial goal:
>To see which speed of the bullets the candidates prefer and if the having coins was better to collect than having rocks
## Describe the trail
>I made an arcade window for testing only the bullets and and set the speed to 6 first. I had the user test that speed and give feedback. I then changed the speed to 20 and had the users test that. I also first had rocks in the place of coins first then changed them to coins to see which they preferred. I also changed the shoot button from having the key Q to having the mouse press as my shoot button.
## Results
> - Braeden preferred having 20 as the speed.
> - Braeden also said that in my game I should make the speed slightly slower so that the player can't go through and collect/kill everything too quickly.
> - Brayden preferred having the rocks instead of the traditional coins.
> - Brayden liked having a space shooter as the character as it was on theme with having rocks as my coins.
> - Braeden liked having the mouse as the shoot button instead of the Q key.
> - Mitchell also preferred having 20 as the speed
## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
 - I will keep the player and the type of coins I have the same.
 - I will change the speed to something between 6 and 20.
 -  I will keep clicking the mouse as the method of shooting


## Trial #2
_Date:_  10/05/2023

Involved in the trial
- Mitchell
- Braeden
- Tawhiri
- Ace
## Trial goal:
>To test whether the candidates prefer enemies coming towards them on the x-axis or enemies coming down on the y-axis
## Describe the trail
>I added enemies spawning above the player and moving down the y-axis as well as the enemies I originally had moving along the x-axis towards the player
## Results
> - Mitchell preferred falling down enemies
> - Mitchell said if the x-axis enemies posed more a threat e.g. , faster, some on ground level and some above the player he would like those
> -  Braeden preferred to have a combination of the two types of enemies
> - Ace preferred the enemies coming from the side if I could make the bullets disappear after it hit the enemies so it could only kill one enemy at a time
> - Ace said I should make enemies coming from all directions instead of just moving down and sideways in a straight line
> - Tawhiri preferred enemies along the x-axis
> - Tawhiri made the suggestion that the side ways enemies spawn on the other side of the player and they move towards the player like they are following it
> - Tawhiri suggested that I also make the bullets disappear after it hits the enemy so you can only kill one at a time

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I will change my code so that a bullet can only hit one thing at a time and the bullet dies after hitting the thing
> - I will try adding enemies coming from all directions
> -I will change the enemies on the x-axis so that they move faster and they spawn at different levels 
> - I will make the enemies on the x-axis spawn behind the player and move forward towards the player
> - I will make the enemies on the x-axis spawn behind the player and move forward towards the player


## Trial 3:
Date: 18/06/2023
Involved in the trial
- T Kiwa
- Tawhiri
- Ace
## Trial goal:
>To see whether candidates prefer Having the E key or the enter key for climbing a ladder or the Q key.

## Describe the trail
>I created a trial map to use for this and trialed candidates with first the E key for climbing, then the Q key for going up.

## Results
-  Ace made a suggestion that I should have a key for climbing up and down as I had only previously had a key for climbing up the ladder with a key and not down the ladder. 
- For this suggestion Ace said I should have the Q key for goin up then the E key for climbing down the ladder.
- T Kiwa said that he preferred having the E key to climb
## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
- I have taken Ace up on their suggestion and added the climbing up and down feature. 
- I have made the the E key for going up and the Q key for going down.


## Trial 4:
Date: 26/07/2023
Involved in this trial:
- Tawhiri
- T Kiwa
- Ace
## Trial goal
In this trial I got candidates to test whether they prefer having a red and white mushroom as coins which is full 128px by 128px size and a brown mushroom as a do not touch layer that kills the player. Or vice versa with the red and white mushroom being the do not touch layer and the brown mushrooms being the coins.
## Describe the trail 
I created a trial map where the coins and do not touch objects where placed around the map where they could just test it out as they were playing the game. I then switched it around and see which one they preferred.
## Results
- Ace preferred having the brown mushrooms as coins mostly because of the fact they were smaller and having coins the same size as the player may be odd
- Ace also preferred having the red and white mushrooms as the do not touch layer as it has connotations of red and white mushrooms being poisonous when consumed.
- Ace however said that maybe I should design a mushroom that looks more poisonous to the touch.
- Tawhiri said he preferred having the red and white mushrooms as the do not touch layer  he once again said that they were known to be poisonous
- T Kiwa said that he preferred having the red and white mushrooms as the do not touch because it made sense
- T Kiwa also made a suggestion that as well as the brown mushrooms for coins I could have different coloured mushrooms that give a different amount of points
## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
- I have added different types of mushrooms worth a different amount of points
- I have decided to keep the red and white mushrooms as the do not touch layer.

## Trial 5:
Date: 3/07/2023
Involved in this trial:
## Trial goal
- Ace
- Bede
- Braeden
## Describe the trail
For my last trial I compared the brown mushrooms and fairy wands to see which one the end users preferred having as their coins.
## Results
- Ace preferred having the fairy wands as coins as I already had mushrooms in the game serving a purpose.
- Braeden also preferred having the fairy wands as coins instead of the brown mushroom as it was more fitting to the character
- Bede preferred having the brown mushrooms as the coins as he liked the design of the mushrooms better
## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
- After the results of this trial I have decided to change the brown mushrooms as the coins that players collect.
