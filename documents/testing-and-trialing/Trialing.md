Trial #1
_Date:_  4/04/2023

Involved in the trial
>- Mitchell
>- Braedyn
>- 

## Trial goal:
>To see which speed of the bullets the candidates prefer and if the having coins was better to collect than having rocks


## Describe the trail
>I made an aracde window for testing only the bullets and and set the speed to 6 first. I had the user test that speed and give feedback. i then changed the speed to 20 and had the users test that. I also first had rocks in the place of coins first then changed them to coins to see which they prefered. I also changed the shoot button from having the key Q to having the mouse press as my shoot button.

## Results
> - Braedyn preferred having 20 as the speed.
> - Braedyn also said that in my game I should make the speed slightly slower so that the player can't go through and collect/kill everything too quickly.
> - Brayden preferred having the rocks instead of the traditional coins.
> - Brayden liked having a space shooter as the character as it was on theme with having rocks as my coins.
> - Braedyn liked having the mouse as the shoot button instead of the Q key.
> - Mitchell also preferred having 20 as the speed


## Breifly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I will keep the player and the type of coins I have the same.
> - I will change the speed to something between 6 and 20.
> - I will keep clicking the mouse as the method of shooting


Trial #2
_Date:_  10/05/2023

Involved in the trial
>- Mitchell
>- Braedyn
>- Tawhiri
>- Ace


## Trial goal:
>To test wether the candidates prefer enemies coming towards them on the x-axis or enemies coming down on the y-axis

## Describe the trail
>I added enemies spawning above the player and moving down the y-axis as well as the enemies I originally had moving along the x-axis towards the player

## Results
> - Mitchell preffered falling down enemies
> - Mitchell said if the x-axis enemies posed more a threat e.g. , faster, some on ground level and some above the player he would like those
> -  Braedyn preferred to have a combination of the two types of enemies
> - Ace preferred the enemies coming from the side if I could make the bullets dissapear after it hit the enemies so it could only kill one enemy at a time
> - Ace said I shpuld make enemies coming from all directions instead of just moving down and sideways in a straight line
> - Tawhiri preferred enemies along the x-axis
> - Tawhiri made the suggestion that theside ways enemies spawn on the other side of the player and they move towards the player like they are following it
> - Tawhiri suggested that I also make the bullets dissapear after it hits the enemy so you can only kill one at a time

## Breifly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I will change my code so that a bullet can only hit one thing at a time and the bullet dies after hitting the thing
> - I will try adding enemies coming from all directions
> -I will change the enemies on the x-axis so that they move faster and they spawn at different levels 
> - I will make the enemies on the x-axis spawn behind the player and move foward towards the player
