>- Mitchell
>- Braedyn
>- 

## Trial goal:
>To see which speed of the bullets the candidates prefer and if the having coins was better to collect than having rocks


## Describe the trail
>I made an aracde window for testing only the bullets and and set the speed to 6 first. I had the user test that speed and give feedback. i then changed the speed to 20 and had the users test that. I also first had rocks in the place of coins first then changed them to coins to see which they prefered. I also changed the shoot button from having the key Q to having the mouse press as my shoot button.

## Results
> - Braedyn preferred having 20 as the speed.
> - Braedyn also said that in my game I should make the speed slightly slower so that the player can't go through and collect/kill everything too quickly.
> - Brayden preferred having the rocks instead of the traditional coins.
> - Brayden liked having a space shooter as the character as it was on theme with having rocks as my coins.
> - Braedyn liked having the mouse as the shoot button instead of the Q key.
> - Mitchell also preferred having 20 as the speed


## Breifly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I will keep the player and the type of coins I have the same.
> - I will change the speed to something between 6 and 20.
