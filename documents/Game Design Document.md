# {Arcade Game}

# Elevator pitch

My game is 2D Arcade style MVP. It contains enemies, coins, and other interactables. It is set in a world I have created suing software I have created assets such as my own art and sound effects/music. I have coded this game using python.

# Concept Overview

### Genre: 2D Arcade game

### Target audience:

> Age: 16-35
> Gender: everyone
> 

# Theme and setting
The theme of my game is a player trying to reach an objective and using abilities I have coded in as well as map design. I have also made sure to implement enemies and map features that harm the player to make this game a challenge. The setting of my game is a mystical forest. I will describe the setting of the game in more detail in my game description.

# Project scope

## Our team
My team consisted of me to develop my game.

# Timeline

My time line began in term one and carried through to the beginning of term 3. I have made a total of 5 sprint documents that have a 2 week span. These sprint documents track my progress with my game.

# Success Criteria
Considering your intended audience and the objectives of your game come up with 5 or more criteria that you will use to determine if your game has been successful. 
What evidence will you use to measure each criteria? 

|     | Criteria | Evidence |
| --- | -------- | -------- |
| 1   |Player can kill enemies          |          |
| 2   |Player can collect coins          |          |
| 3   |Player can move, jump and, climb          |          |
| 4   |Player can lose          |          |
| 5   |Player can shoot          |          |
| 6    | Art is relevant to game         |          |


# Game Description

Set in a mystical forest. A fairy must travel through the forest and avoid the evil gnomes, poisonous mushrooms and cursed water. Fairy dust may be used as a weapon against the gnomes. There are 2 types of mushrooms, one is poisonous the other increases the fairy's score allowing them to move up levels to the final goal. 

The main character is a colourful fairy who is kind and on a quest to find the magical potion at the end of the game . The user playing as the fairy must avoid obstacles and parkour their way through a tricky forest. The main character must reach the potion in time to heal their friend again as the poisonous mushrooms have already started to kick in.

The evil gnomes , the short tiny stocky creatures with red and white stockings and a pointy oversized hat that covers their eyes, and are working together to try and stop the fairy from reaching the potion to save their friend. The Gnomes believe only they have the right to the potion and outsiders are not worthy of it.

My player is able to climb, walk and jump in my world. My player will move using the W, A, D keys and use E to climb up the ladder and Q to climb down the ladder. The character also has the ability to shoot, this ability can be accessed by clicking the left mouse button . The player follows conventional gravity aspects and uses a realistic movement speed set in the code.

In my world there are platforms that the user may use to their advantage such as being able to move up easier however if they miss that then the player must use ladders to climb, if the player is unable to use the ladder in time it could result in the player colliding with something that will cause them to lose their progress. 

When playing this game the character can interact with several things in my world such as collecting coins. To collect the coins you must run into them, this will result in an increase of score. The character can also collide with anything that harms then such as the evil Gnomes, cursed water and, poisonous mushrooms. This will result in a decrease of health points. You can climb up and down any of the ladders which I have implemented in my physics engine. When the player accesses the shoot function their aim is to kill the evil gnomes. I have decided not to implement the player having the ability to shoot my tiles such as the cursed water and poisonous mushrooms as it is part of the map.

I thought it would be most conventional to have the gnomes as standing still enemies. Once an evil gnome comes into contact with the players character the health decreases by one.  To overcome the gnomes the player can either shoot them which kills the gnomes, or the player can simply avoid them. However I have designed the map in a way that makes it difficult to avoid the gnomes. The player has 5 health points. Once the player loses all points they must restart the game. 
# Gameplay

My player does not have any dialogue in my game in audio or text form. I would implement dialogue in my game if there was more than one main character like a main boss at the end of the game that my player needed to converse with for the plot. 
## UI elements

The player knows which keys to use and how to move and interact with my game as I will have text on the screen describing which keys to use for certain movements. I do not have an inventory to my game. The player knows the purpose of the game as it will be described in the on view that is first displayed when then game is ran.
# Technical Requirements
## Required Technologies
I will develop my game by writing the code for it and creating the map in tiled that the player will interact with. I am using the language of python to write my code. I used the program Aseprite to develop relevant art for my game to make it look attractive. I used the website beep box to design my own music for the game that fits the theme. For the player to run the game they must have an application that is able to run code as well as a folder with all the appropriate assets in the folder such as the art, the maps and, the mp3 files. I could distribute my game by sending them a compressed folder with everything necessary in there.

# Required Assets
## Art 
### Objects
- Coin "Brown mushroom"
- Poisonous "Red and white mushroom"
- Evil Gnome/Elf
- Health
- Fairy dust bullet
- Main character
### Tiles
- Ground
- Left floating platform
- Right floating platform
- Water
- Ladder
## Sounds

### Sound effects
Using beep box I have created sounds when certain actions are performed e.g. Jumping, Shooting, losing  a health point, and losing the game. 
### Music

## Text
The text I have displayed in my game is the short description of the game welcoming the player to start. I then have text in my game that displays the score as well as the score being functional. I also have text displayed on the player lose and player win view.

## {Social}
I have taken this relevant implication into account with my game design by ensuring it is fit for use by all ages, this includes no use of inappropriate language or graphics. I have tried to design and produce my game so that it can resemble that of arcade style games that are on the market. Those users who find games in the genre I have designed it in will hopefully find this game to their liking.
## {Privacy}
Because I have not implicated the ability for my users to create accounts using personal data I do not believe that my game is a threat to users in that aspect. In terms of the user having access to the game on their computer I have made sure my files do not contain any malware or privacy invasive software that may access or harm user data.
## {Intellectual Property}
I have acknowledged others code that I have taken inspiration from and adapted in my game by referencing the source in my repo. Any owners of written code that have a copyright on them I have also made sure to reference, this ensures I follow all copyright policies. Any code I have used in my game I make sure I have tweaked to make it my own original work.
