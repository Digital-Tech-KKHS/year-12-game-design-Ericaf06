# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
Because we had a lot of time off school during this sprint I had to manage my time at home. 
I originally intended on adding moving platforms but I changed my focus on to making a way for the player to win so that I could have an MVP.

The people I used in my trial have helped me decide what to do in relation to enemies from different directions as well as made other suggestions such as speed of enemies and a more zoomed out view of the map.

I have not yet achieved an MVP as I still need to fix some errors however I have started implementing the winning functions and views.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
-Map development
-Windows/views
-Enemies from different directions added

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
Next time I will focus on making an enemy class for my different enemies and final boss enemy as the players way of winning instead of having them all as lists under my game class. I feel this will help me be able to improve my enemies and make my game smoother. 
I am also going to work on fixing bugs in my code before I move on with adding new things, as this might interfere with my new code features.
